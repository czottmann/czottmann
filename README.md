**Hi from Northern Germany!** 👋 I'm Carlo, and currently I focus my development work on [macOS/iOS Shortcuts-related productivity apps](https://actions.work/?ref=github) which bring Shortcuts support to apps that currently don't offer them: Obsidian, Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and more!

I also create and maintain a number of FOSS projects. Here's a selection of what keeps me up at night:

## Projects
- [Linearis](https://github.com/czottmann/linearis): A **CLI tool for Linear.app** with JSON output, smart ID resolution, and optimized GraphQL queries. Designed for LLM agents and humans who prefer structured data.

- [Interfazzle](https://github.com/czottmann/interfazzle): A CLI tool for **building simple Swift Markdown docs** for a package's public interface from its symbol graphs. LLMs love that stuff, too!

- [kagi-ken-cli](https://github.com/czottmann/kagi-ken-cli): Unofficial **CLI client for working with Kagi *without* API access** (you'll need to be a customer). Searches and summarizes, returns JSON results. Uses Kagi session token for easy authentication. Works well with your agent.

- [kagi-ken-mcp](https://github.com/czottmann/kagi-ken-mcp): Unofficial **MCP server for working with Kagi *without* API access** (you'll need to be a customer). Searches and summarizes, returns JSON results. Uses Kagi session token for easy authentication. Works well with your agent.

- [(Unofficial) Anthropic Status Feeds](https://zottmann.dev/anthroping): Automated accounts for both [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@anthroping) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/anthroping.zottmann.dev) that distribute updates published on Anthropic's Status page into posts, as they happen

- [(Unofficial) Apple Developer System Status Feeds](https://zottmann.dev/adss): Automated accounts for both [Mastodon](https://techhub.social/@AppleDeveloperSystemStatus) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/adss.zottmann.dev) that distribute updates published on Apple's System Status and Developer System Status pages into posts and an RSS feed, as they happen

### Obsidian plugins

- [Actions URI](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-actions-uri): Adds many additional `x-callback-url` endpoints to the app for common actions — it's a clean, super-charged addition to Obsidian URI. [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann)

- [Blockquote Levels](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-blockquote-levels): Adds commands for increasing/decreasing the blockquote level of the current line or selection(s) [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann)

- [Copy Search URL](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-copy-search-url): Adds a menu entry to its search view for copying the Obsidian search URL. [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann)

- [Logstravaganza](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-logstravaganza): A simple proxy for `console.*()` calls which copies log messages and uncaught exceptions to a note. Mainly aimed at plugin developers and their customers. [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann)

- [Mononote](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-mononote): Ensures each note occupies only one tab. If a note is already open, its existing tab will be focussed instead of opening the same file in the current tab. Works for opening notes via links, menus, hotkeys. [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann)

## Want to support my open-source work?

I don't accept sponsoring in the "GitHub sponsorship" sense[^1] but [next to my own apps, I also sell "Tokens of Appreciation"](https://actions.work/store/?ref=github). Do with this information what you will. 😉

[^1]: Apparently, the German revenue service is still having some fits over "money for nothing??".
