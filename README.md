**Hi from Northern Germany!** ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carlo and currently I focus my open-source work on plugins and apps related to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), my fave note-taking and planning tool.  Right now, that's these here projects:

| Project | What is it? | |
| - | - | - |
| [Actions for Obsidian](https://obsidian.actions.work/) | 40+ useful new [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) actions for the Shortcuts app on macOS and iOS. | ï£¿ [Available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1659667937) |
| [Actions URI](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-actions-uri) | Adds many additional `x-callback-url` endpoints to the app for common actions â€” it's a clean, super-charged addition to Obsidian URI. | [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann) | 
| [Blockquote Levels](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-blockquote-levels) | Adds commands for increasing/decreasing the blockquote level of the current line or selection(s). | [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann) |
| [Copy Search URL](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-copy-search-url) | Adds a menu entry to its search view for copying the Obsidian search URL. | [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann) |
| [Logstravaganza](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-logstravaganza) | A simple proxy for `console.*()` calls which copies log messages and uncaught exceptions to a note. Mainly aimed at plugin developers and their customers. | [Available as Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann) |
| ðŸš§ [Mononote](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-mononote) | Ensures each note occupies only one tab. If a note is already open, its existing tab will be focussed instead of opening the same file in the current tab. Works for opening notes via links, menus, hotkeys. | [Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=zottmann) review ongoing |
