**Hi from Northern Germany!** üëã I'm Carlo and currently I focus my open-source work on plugins and apps related to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), my fave note-taking and project planning tool.  Right now, it's these here **plugins**:

- [**Actions URI**](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-actions-uri) adds many additional `x-callback-url` endpoints to the app for common actions ‚Äî it's a clean, super-charged addition to Obsidian URI. [üöß WIP]
- [**Blockquote Levels**](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-blockquote-levels) adds commands for increasing/decreasing the blockquote level of the current line or selection(s). (‚è± In review for the Community Plugins section in Obsidian.)
- [**Copy Search URL**](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-copy-search-url) adds a button to its search view for copying the Obsidian search URL. (‚úÖ Available from the Community Plugins section in Obsidian!)
- A big-ass mystery project I'm not ready to talk about. :)
